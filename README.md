# What is this project?

In-progress coursework for my British A-levels. In short it attempts to create a web interface that allows you to upload an exam pdf which will then automatically crop, serve and track user's progress. 


## Installation

Maven was used in the creation of this project. I'd suggest you import it into an IDE such as Intellij and allow the dependencies to auto install.
